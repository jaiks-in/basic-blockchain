Wah bhai — sahi baat! Har acchi project ka ek **solid README.md** hona chahiye.
Main ab tere poore ab tak ke **blockchain project (Phase 1 se Phase 7 tak)** ka ek clean, professional, and developer-friendly `README.md` bana ke deta hoon.

# 🚀 Rust Blockchain From Scratch

A fully working decentralized blockchain built from scratch in **Rust** — covering:
- Block creation
- Proof of Work (mining)
- Transaction management
- Wallet system with ECDSA keypairs
- Transaction signing & verification
- P2P networking over TCP
- Block propagation to peers

---

## 📚 Project Phases

| Phase | Description |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Phase 1 | Basic Blockchain with block struct and hash generation |
| ✅ Phase 2 | Proof of Work mining mechanism (difficulty-based hash target) |
| ✅ Phase 3 | Transaction struct and transaction pool |
| ✅ Phase 4 | Mining pending transactions with rewards |
| ✅ Phase 5 | Blockchain integrity verification (is_valid) |
| ✅ Phase 6 | Wallet system with ECDSA (p256) keypairs, transaction signing & verification |
| ✅ Phase 7 | P2P networking over TCP — nodes communicate, share and accept mined blocks |

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 📥 Install dependencies
```bash
cargo build
````

### 🏃 Run the blockchain node

```bash
cargo run
```

## 📡 Running P2P Nodes

In **one terminal:**

```bash
cargo run
```

In **another terminal** (on a different port or IP)
modify `network.rs` → change port in `start_server()`
and re-run:

```bash
cargo run
```

Now they can send and receive blocks over TCP.

## 📦 Tech Stack

* 🦀 Rust
* 📚 Serde (for JSON serialization)
* 🔐 SHA256 (sha2 crate)
* ⛏️ p256 ECDSA (for wallet and transaction signing)
* ⚡ Tokio (for future async networking extensions)
* 📡 TCP (for P2P node communication)

---

## 🔒 Wallet System

* Each wallet generates an **ECDSA (p256)** public-private keypair.
* Transactions are signed using the sender’s private key.
* Receivers verify the transaction using the sender’s public key.
* Mining rewards come from a special `"System"` address.

---

## 📡 P2P Networking

* Nodes run TCP servers on configurable ports.
* Nodes can broadcast mined blocks to peers.
* Peers receive blocks, verify, and add them to their own chain if valid.

---

## 📜 Next Phases (Future Roadmap)

* Phase 8: Distributed Consensus (Longest chain rule + fork resolution)
* Phase 9: Asynchronous networking with `Tokio` or `libp2p`
* Phase 10: WebSocket-based P2P node discovery
* Phase 11: Simple Web UI Dashboard for monitoring chain
